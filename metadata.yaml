description: "Ayesha, the Return of She is a gothic-fantasy novel by the popular Victorian\
  \ author H. Rider Haggard, published in 1905, as a sequel to his far more popular\
  \ and well known novel, She. It was serialised in the Windsor Magazine in 1904-5.\n\
  Its significance was recognised by its republication by the Newcastle Publishing\
  \ Company as the fourteenth volume of the celebrated Newcastle Forgotten Fantasy\
  \ Library series in October 1977.\nIn the introduction, Sir H. Rider Haggard links\
  \ the name Ayesha to Muhammad's wives, and the Arabic name (Arabic: عائشة, ʻĀʼishah,\
  \ pronounced [ˈʕaːʔiʃa]), stating that it should be pronounced \"Assha\" /ˈɑːʃə/,\
  \ although the pronunciation A·ye·sha /ɑːˈjɛʃə/ or /ɑːˈjiːʃə/ is perhaps more common.\n\
